Context

->  It provides a way to pass data through component tree without

    having to pass props down manually at every level


-> For ex: in 'why-context.png', suppose  component 'D' anf 'F' require username property

    but not all components require it. Still we have to manually pass down 'username'

    prop all the way down. It can get tedious if the component tree is really big 

->  ex: Components 'C', 'E' and 'F'. UserContext.js
