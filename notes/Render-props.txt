Render Props

->  HOC and React Props are for same purposes.

->  Render prop is a technique for sharing code between react components

    using a prop whose value is a function.

    Ex: RenderProps.js (basic example showing we can have function as prop's value).

    Ex: Counter.js and ClickCounterTwo.js
