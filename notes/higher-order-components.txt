Higher Order components (HOC)

    withCounter.js is HOC ,  ClickCounter.js and HoverCounter.js are regular components

->  to share common functionality between components

->  A pattern where a function takes component as an arguement

    and returns a new component

->  Ex: we need 2 components where one component increments counter 
    based on no. of times a button is clicked

    Another component also increments counter bu based on hovering
    on the heading

    So we can see we need some common functionality to add counter in state
    and incrementing it

    We can do this in regular way but it will have code duplication

    So ....
