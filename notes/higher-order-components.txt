Higher Order components (HOC)

    withCounter.js is HOC ,  ClickCounter.js and HoverCounter.js are regular components

->  to share common functionality between components

->  A pattern where a function takes component as an arguement

    and returns a new component

->  Things To take care while writing HOC:

    If you are passing props to <ClickCounter/> and <HoverCounter/> in App.js
    then you cannot use them in respective components directly when they are passed to HOC.
    You have to use:

        see line no 22 in withCounter.js file

->  Ex: we need 2 components where one component increments counter 
    based on no. of times a button is clicked

    Another component also increments counter bu based on hovering
    on the heading

    So we can see we need some common functionality to add counter in state
    and incrementing it

    We can do this in regular way but it will have code duplication

    So ....
